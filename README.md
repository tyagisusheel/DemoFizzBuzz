# DemoFizzBuzz

I have created the Console based Demo application for "DemoFizzBuzz" for find the valied number entered by the user from command line is a multiple of 3 or 5.

I have implemented the Dot.Net best practices, Software Development best practices, Test Driven Development Best Practices with  SOLID Principles and "Factory pattern" Software Design Patterns and update the source code on Source Control Best Practices (Github).#

The main function as below :-

If the User enter numeric digit like "3, 6, 9 ,15, 30" than the command line result will display as "Fizz"
If the User enter numeric digit like "5, 10, 20 ,25" than the command line result will display as "Buzz"
If the User enter numeric digit with combination of 3 and 5 like "15, 30" than the command line result will display as "Fizz Buzz"
